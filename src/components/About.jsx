                        I am a passionate learner and aspiring full-stack web developer,
                        currently studying at Masai School, where I am honing my technical skills
                        and gaining practical experience through project-based learning.
                        Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Science from
                        Kumaon University, Nainital. I completed my 12th grade education
                        from Him Jyoti School, Dehradun, where I developed a passion for technology and problem-solving.
                        I am eager to apply all my skills to real-world projects as a
                        full-stack web developer.
                        Outside of web development, I have a diverse range of interests and hobbies
                        that keep me engaged and inspired. As a sports enthusiast,
                        I am an avid table tennis player and have participated and won in
                        several competitions at the district and state level. In my free time,
                        I also enjoy photography. Reading is another passion of mine, When I'm not reading,
                        you can often find me singing, dancing, or learning new things,
                        as I enjoy challenging myself and exploring new opportunities
                        for personal growth.
